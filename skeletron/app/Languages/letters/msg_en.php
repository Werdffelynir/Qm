<h2 class="title">Using namespaces: Aliasing/Importing</h2>
<p class="verinfo">(PHP 5 >= 5.3.0)</p>
<p class="para"> The ability to refer to an external fully qualified name with an alias, or importing, is an important feature of namespaces. This is similar to the ability of unix-based filesystems to create symbolic links to a file or to a directory. </p>
<p class="para"> PHP namespaces support three kinds of aliasing or importing: aliasing a class name, aliasing an interface name, and aliasing a namespace name. Note that importing a function or constant is not supported. </p>
